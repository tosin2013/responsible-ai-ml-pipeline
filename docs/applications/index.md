Examples of using OpenShift's orchestration capabilities to ensure high availability, scalability, and resource efficiency. In these examples IBM AI Fairness 360 will use OpenShift's built-in security features for authentication and authorization. The workload might also integrate with other AI/ML tools in the OpenShift ecosystem, such as Jupyter notebooks for interactive analysis or MLflow for model tracking. Overall, this setup would enable data scientists and developers to easily incorporate fairness considerations into their ML workflows within a robust, cloud-native environment.
