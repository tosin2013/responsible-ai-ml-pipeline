## Overcoming Bias in AI and Machine Learning

Welcome to the Responsible AI ML Pipeline, a project aimed at addressing the critical challenge of bias in AI and machine learning. Our mission is to provide tools and frameworks that enable data scientists and machine learning engineers to develop fair and ethical AI systems. This project integrates IBM AI Fairness 360 (AIF360) with Red Hat OpenShift to offer a robust solution for detecting and mitigating bias in AI models.

### Key Features

- **Bias Detection**: Utilize AIF360 to identify biases in datasets and machine learning models.
- **Bias Mitigation**: Implement strategies to reduce and eliminate bias in AI workflows.
- **Scalability**: Leverage Kubernetes and OpenShift for scalable AI deployments.
- **Security**: Benefit from the robust security features of Red Hat OpenShift.
- **Reproducibility**: Ensure consistent results by using containerized environments.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automate your responsible AI pipeline with continuous integration and delivery.

## Our Vision

We aim to foster a community where ethical AI practices are the norm rather than the exception. By providing open-source tools and comprehensive documentation, we hope to make it easier for organizations to adopt responsible AI practices.
