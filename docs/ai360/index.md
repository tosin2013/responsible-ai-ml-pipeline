# AI Fairness 360

IBM's AI Fairness 360 (AIF360) is an open-source toolkit designed to help developers and data scientists detect, understand, and mitigate bias in machine learning models. This toolkit is part of the LF AI incubation project and is available in both Python and R. It aims to translate algorithmic fairness research into practical applications across various domains, including finance, healthcare, human capital management, and education.

AIF360 provides a comprehensive suite of tools, including over 70 fairness metrics and 10 state-of-the-art bias mitigation algorithms. These metrics and algorithms help users assess and address biases at multiple stages of the machine learning pipeline, from training data to model predictions. Some notable bias mitigation techniques include optimized preprocessing, reweighing, adversarial debiasing, and equalized odds post-processing.

The toolkit also includes extensive documentation, tutorials, and interactive web demos to guide users through the process of bias detection and mitigation. Additionally, it features Jupyter Notebooks with practical examples and a Slack channel for community support and collaboration.

By offering these resources, AI Fairness 360 aims to foster the development of fairer and more equitable AI systems, ensuring that AI benefits are accessible to all.
