    "# Discover, Measure, and Mitigate Bias in Advertising\n",
    "This tutorial illustrates how bias in advertising (ad) data can be discovered, measured, and mitigated using the **AI Fairness 360 (AIF360) toolkit**. We use data from advertising, where advertisments are targeted, and the actual and predicted conversions are collected along with additional attributes about each user. A user is considered to have actually converted when they click on an advertisement.  This tutorial demonstrates how methods in the AIF360 toolkit can be used to discover biased subgroups, determine the amount of bias, and mitigate this bias. "

   "source": [
    "* To demonstrate discovery, measurement, and mitigation of bias in advertising,  we use a dataset that contains synthetic generated data of all users who were shown a certain advertisement. Each instance of the dataset has feature attributes such as gender, age, income, political/religious affiliation, parental status, home ownership, area (rural/urban), and education status. The predicted probability of conversion along with the binary predicted conversion, which is obtained by thresholding the predicted probability, is included. In addition, the binary true conversion, based on whether the user actually clicked on the ad is also included. A user is considered to have converted (true conversion=1) if they clicked on the ad.\n",
    "* This data is typically gathered using an ad targeting platform, where dynamic creative optimization algorithms target users who are more likely to click on the ad creative (more likely to convert). Targeting involves choosing user specific attributes such as designated market area (DMA), age group, income etc. and showing the particular ad to those users who have these attributes.\n",
    "* After the ad campaign is completed, the ad data is obtained from various ad data management platforms. They are used with the AIF360 toolkit to: (1) discover the subgroups that exhibit high predictive bias using the multidimensional subset scan (MDSS) method, (2) measure the bias exhibited by these subgroups using various metrics, and (3) mitigate bias using post-processing bias mitigation approaches. MDSS is a technique used to identify the subset of attributes and corresponding feature values (aka subgroups) that have the most predictive bias. The group with the highest predictive bias is designated as \"privileged\", and the rest of the records belong to \"unprivileged\" groups in our analysis. Note that the use of terms privileged and unprivileged in this analysis does not correspond to socioeconomic privilege.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Additional Notes:**\n",
    "* Unlike some other applications such as credit approval, where sensitive/protected features such as gender are known because of regulations, in the ad industry a key difference is that this is not known a-priori and hence necessitates the use of bias discovery methods such as MDSS.\n",
    "* We use a post-processing bias mitigation approach (Reject Option Classification or ROC) since the dataset with true and predicted conversions is already provided. Pre- or in-processing approches can also be used in situations where we have access to the training data or model training algorithms of the ad targeting platform respectively."
