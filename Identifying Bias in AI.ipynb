In this exercise, you'll train a model with **real data** and get practice with identifying bias.  Don't worry if you're new to coding: you'll still be able to complete the exercise!\n\n# Introduction\n\nAt the end of 2017, the [Civil Comments](https://medium.com/@aja_15265/saying-goodbye-to-civil-comments-41859d3a2b1d) platform shut down and released their ~2 million public comments in a lasting open archive. Jigsaw sponsored this effort and helped to comprehensively annotate the data.  In 2019, Kaggle held the [Jigsaw Unintended Bias in Toxicity Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-unintended-bias-in-toxicity-classification/overview) competition so that data scientists worldwide could work together to investigate ways to mitigate bias.\n\nThe code cell below loads some of the data from the competition.  We'll work with thousands of comments, where each comment is labeled as either \"toxic\" or \"not toxic\".\n\nBegin by running the next code cell.  \n- Clicking inside the code cell.\n- Click on the triangle (in the shape of a \"Play button\") that appears to the left of the code cell.\n\nThe code will run for approximately 30 seconds.  When it finishes, you should see as output a message saying that the data was successfully loaded, along with two examples of comments: one is toxic, and the other is not.","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.014195,"end_time":"2020-10-30T19:06:15.040067","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-10-30T19:06:15.025872","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Set up feedback system\nfrom learntools.core import binder\nbinder.bind(globals())\nfrom learntools.ethics.ex3 import *\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer\n\n# Get the same results each time\nnp.random.seed(0)\n\n# Load the training data\ndata = pd.read_csv(\"../input/jigsaw-snapshot/data.csv\")\ncomments = data[\"comment_text\"]\ntarget = (data[\"target\"]>0.7).astype(int)\n\n# Break into training and test sets\ncomments_train, comments_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(comments, target, test_size=0.30, stratify=target)\n\n# Get vocabulary from training data\nvectorizer = CountVectorizer()\nvectorizer.fit(comments_train)\n\n# Get word counts for training and test sets\nX_train = vectorizer.transform(comments_train)\nX_test = vectorizer.transform(comments_test)\n\n# Preview the dataset\nprint(\"Data successfully loaded!\\n\")\nprint(\"Sample toxic comment:\", comments_train.iloc[22])\nprint(\"Sample not-toxic comment:\", comments_train.iloc[17])","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":30.692706,"end_time":"2020-10-30T19:06:45.747191","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-10-30T19:06:15.054485","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-05-23T19:40:06.010801Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-05-23T19:40:06.011170Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-05-23T19:40:19.661139Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-05-23T19:40:06.011140Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-05-23T19:40:19.660286Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Run the next code cell without changes to use the data to train a simple model.
